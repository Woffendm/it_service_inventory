# it_service_inventory

Requires ruby 1.9.3 and bundler to be installed. I also recommend using RVM.

Be sure to run "bundle install" first.

In the config directory be sure to rename both of the .yml-dist file extensions to .yml and populate them with your data.

Install the database using rake (rake db:create, etc.).

Start the rails server (rails s).
